## Introduction

Association rule mining is a technique used to identify patterns and relationships between items in large datasets. In this project, the Apriori algorithm is employed to discover frequent itemsets and association rules from a given dataset. The resulting rules can provide insights into item relationships and can be applied in areas such as market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and decision-making.

## Features

- Uses the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.
- Uncovers frequent itemsets and association rules in a dataset.
- Can handle various datasets with transactional data.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to perform association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm.
    ```bash
    python association_rule_mining.py
    ```

2. **Provide Input**:
    - The script will prompt you to input parameters such as the minimum support and confidence for rule mining.

3. **Receive Results**:
    - The system will display the discovered frequent itemsets and association rules based on the input parameters.

## Data

- The dataset used in this project contains transactional data.
- Each transaction consists of a list of items purchased together.
- The dataset is processed and used for mining association rules.

## Apriori Algorithm

- The Apriori algorithm is used for discovering frequent itemsets and association rules in the dataset.
- The algorithm proceeds as follows:
    - **Find Frequent Itemsets**: The algorithm iterates through the dataset, starting with individual items, to find itemsets that meet the minimum support threshold.
    - **Generate Association Rules**: Once frequent itemsets are identified, the algorithm generates association rules from them that meet the minimum confidence threshold.

## Code Explanation

- **association_rule_mining.py**:
    - The script for loading the dataset, running the Apriori algorithm, and displaying the results.
    - Takes user input for parameters such as minimum support and confidence.
    - Outputs the frequent itemsets and association rules that meet the input thresholds.
